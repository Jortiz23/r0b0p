## TODO for r0b0p

number of stars means NUMBER OF DIFFICULTY LEVELS

- add break/continue lol
- talk with toal about our scope
  - index out of bounds error? is this runtime or semantic?
- change id 'ref' to 'name' cause that is nicer

optional future additions:

- add classes
- add kwargs

List of semantic checks to keep in mind:

- number of arguments = number of parameters
- scope rules
- public/private rules

LIST OF QUESTIONS/problems:

1. Do we need to add an IntLit to the for loop context if there is no ID assigned to it?
2. think about scope
3. should we be defining string interpolation NOWWWW at this moment in time right now????
