## TODO for r0b0p

stars for difficulty

- work on lightning talk slides
- make unclear as a primitive type like we intended? + more tests
- remove parensexp \* adriana
- move r0b0p false in check and r0b0p true in analyzer to builtins and export them there (and also export to js generator) \*\* adriana
- add functions to vars and vars to functions to list of static semantic errors (on readme) \* adriana

optional future additions:

- add classes
- add kwargs
