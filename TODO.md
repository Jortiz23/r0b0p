## TODO for r0b0p

stars for difficulty

- maybe do something so that floats have .0 lol \*adriana
- figure out how to differentiate first time assignment and repeated assignment for the 'let' problem

optional future additions:

- that darned dollar sign
- make print a builtin lol
- non-interpolated text class (quasi class?), so that when we optimize if we have no placeholders we can make that a thing
