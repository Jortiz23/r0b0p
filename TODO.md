## TODO for r0b0p

stars for difficulty

- work on lightning talk slides
- OPERNAD SHOULDNT BE THE NAME IN THE NEGATION AND THE UNARY STUFF AHHHH \*maddie
- maybe do something so that floats have .0 lol \*adriana
- pull out checking for block statements length, make function called 'reduce blocks to statement' \*merissa
- everyone try and look at optimizations
- binary optimization \*merissa
- make dicts double curly braces instead of single lol

optional future additions:

- that darned dollar sign
- make print a builtin lol
- non-interpolated text class (quasi class?), so that when we optimize if we have no placeholders we can make that a thing

questions for toal:

- do we have enough optimization?
