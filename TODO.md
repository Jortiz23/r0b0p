## TODO for r0b0p

stars for difficulty

- work on lightning talk slides
- make unclear as a primitive type like we intended? + more tests
- rename all of the check functions basically \* maddie
- for loop context issue \*\* maddie
- remove parensexp \* adriana
- remove error in analyzer because it should be in check \* merissa
- move r0b0p false to builtins and export it there \*\* adriana
- comment about unreachable code, this check only applies to statements at the level of this block, line 100 area in analyzer (nested blocks ok) \* maddie
- functions to vars and vars to functions for static semantic errors (on readme) \* adriana
- code generation, replace all "s.replace(/\s+/g, '');", ".replace(/\_\d+/g, '')" \*\* merissa
- linter path thing \* merissa

optional future additions:
