## TODO for r0b0p

number of stars means NUMBER OF DIFFICULTY LEVELS

- change < > for blocks to something else like << >> or other unicode characters (ask toal)
- add tests for dictionary methods (adriana)
- ast printer
  - toal wants '-a FILE_NAME' to run AST ( see problem 2 on hw )

optional future additions:

- add classes
- add kwargs

List of semantic checks to keep in mind:

- number of arguments = number of parameters
- scope rules
- public/private rules
