## TODO for r0b0p

number of stars means NUMBER OF DIFFICULTY LEVELS

- add string interpolation tests (straight from readme) (adriana)
- check if the things that can precede Exp1 and the things that can precede a block are disjoint
- talk with toal about our scope
  - index out of bounds error? is this runtime or semantic?

optional future additions:

- add classes
- add kwargs

List of semantic checks to keep in mind:

- number of arguments = number of parameters
- scope rules
- public/private rules
