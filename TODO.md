## TODO for r0b0p

number of stars means NUMBER OF DIFFICULTY LEVELS

- check if the things that can precede Exp1 and the things that can precede a block are disjoint
- add break lol
- talk with toal about our scope
  - index out of bounds error? is this runtime or semantic?

optional future additions:

- add classes
- add kwargs

List of semantic checks to keep in mind:

- number of arguments = number of parameters
- scope rules
- public/private rules

LIST OF QUESTIONS/problems:

1. Do we need to add an IntLit to the for loop context if there is no ID assigned to it?
2. think about scope
3. change id 'ref' to 'name' cause that is nicer
