## TODO for r0b0p

number of stars means NUMBER OF DIFFICULTY LEVELS

- change < > for blocks to something else like << >> or other unicode characters (ask toal)
- add tests for dictionary/list methods (adriana)
- add string interpolation tests (straight from readme)
- add program class

optional future additions:

- add classes
- add kwargs

List of semantic checks to keep in mind:

- number of arguments = number of parameters
- scope rules
- public/private rules
