## TODO for r0b0p

stars for difficulty

- check if we have semantic analysis for uncl3ar \* Adriana
- add test (semantic?) to make sure that you can have a all caps var and lowercase var w same names and one is readonly and one isn't \* Adriana
- figure out if we need to define semantics for + (concatenating) for string??
- work on lightning talk slides

optional future additions:

- add classes
- add kwargs
