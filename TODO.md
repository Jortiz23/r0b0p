## TODO for r0b0p

stars for difficulty

- work on lightning talk slides
- either silence warnings or make variables used \*\* maddie
- try and put built ins from generator into separate file and export/import \* adriana
- semicolons for simple statements in code generation (let z = add(5, 4);;) **\*\*\*\***
- bool lit problem--in generator, we have to assume that all boollits are true or false because of branching coverage issues!!! \***\*\*\*\***

optional future additions:

- that darned dollar sign
- add classes
- add kwargs

questions for toal:

- bool lit problem
- semicolons
